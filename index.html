    <h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I'm an Enterprise Online Engagement Manager living in Brooklyn. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because Max Alexander told me that I needed to do it.</p>

<h2>My Mission</h2>

<p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day work as a circus bear with Bryan Horvath because I like to work in a underwater environment.</p>
